NAME
----
disorderfs - FUSE filesystem that introduces non-determinism


SYNOPSIS
--------
*disorderfs* ['OPTIONS'...] 'ROOTDIR' 'MOUNTPOINT'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*disorderfs* is an overlay FUSE filesystem that introduces non-determinism
into filesystem metadata.  For example, it can randomize the order
in which directory entries are read.  This is useful for detecting
non-determinism in the build process.

'ROOTDIR' is the underlying directory that is to be mirrored, and 'MOUNTPOINT' is
where the overlay should be mounted.


OPTIONS
-------
See fusermount(1), mount.fuse(8), and mount(8) for a full list of options.

Options specific to *disorderfs*:

*--help*, *-h*::
  Display help.

*--version*, *-V*::
  Display the version.


BUGS
----
Errors from close are not properly reported.

fsync is not implemented.

Locks are not propagated to the underlying filesystem.
