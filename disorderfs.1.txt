NAME
----
disorderfs - FUSE filesystem that introduces non-determinism


SYNOPSIS
--------
*disorderfs* ['OPTIONS'...] 'ROOTDIR' 'MOUNTPOINT'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*disorderfs* is an overlay FUSE filesystem that introduces non-determinism
into filesystem metadata.  For example, it can randomize the order
in which directory entries are read.  This is useful for detecting
non-determinism in the build process.

'ROOTDIR' is the absolute path to the underlying directory that is to
be mirrored, and 'MOUNTPOINT' is where the overlay should be mounted.


OPTIONS
-------
See fusermount(1), mount.fuse(8), and mount(8) for a full list of options.

Options specific to *disorderfs*:

*--shuffle-dirents=yes|no*::
  Whether or not to randomly shuffle directory entries (default: no).
  The directory entries are shuffled every time the directory is read,
  so repeated reads of the same directory will probably return different
  results.

*--reverse-dirents=yes|no*::
  Whether or not to return directory entries in reverse order (default: yes).

*--pad-blocks='N'*::
  Add 'N' to the st_blocks field in struct stat(2) (default: 1).

*--help*, *-h*::
  Display help.

*--version*, *-V*::
  Display the version.


BUGS
----
Errors from close are not properly reported.

fsync and fdatasync are not implemented (they report success but do not
do anything).

Locks are not propagated to the underlying filesystem.  Locks still work
within disorderfs itself, but if one process accesses the underlying
filesystem directly, and another process accesses through disorderfs,
they won't see each others' locks.

'ROOTDIR' must be specified as an absolute path ('MOUNTPOINT' may be
absolute or relative).
