disorderfs - FUSE filesystem that introduces non-determinism

disorderfs is an overlay FUSE filesystem that introduces non-determinism
into filesystem metadata.  For example, it can randomize the order
in which directory entries are read.  This is useful for detecting
non-determinism in the build process.

See the man page for details.
